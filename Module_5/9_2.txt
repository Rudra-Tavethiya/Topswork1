How do you manage privileges using these commands?



grant privileges : we can assign specific permissions to users depending on what actions they are allowed to perform on database objects.

        ex : here we are allow select & insert permissions to the user1 in customer table in shop database

            code : grant select,insert on shop.customer to 'user1'@'localhost';



revoke privileges : When a user no longer needs access or their permissions need to be restricted, we can remove specific privileges.

        ex : here we are remove select permission from user1 in customer table in shop database

            code : revoke select on lec_18_12.customer from 'user1'@'localhost';
