SELECT      : Specifies the columns to retrieve.
FROM        : Identifies the source table.
WHERE       : Filters rows based on a salary condition.
GROUP BY    : Groups rows by department.
HAVING      : Filters the grouped data based on the average salary.
ORDER BY    : Sorts the results in descending order of average salary.
LIMIT       : Restricts the output to the top 3 results.
