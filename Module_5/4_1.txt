Define the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL)



Data Definition Language (DDL) : it is a subset of SQL used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables too.
                                 DDL commands do not manipulate the data within the tables but instead focus on the database schema itself.


Common DDL Commands : 

1. CREATE : Creates new database objects like tables, views, or indexes.

2. ALTER : Modifies the structure of existing database objects.

3. DROP : Deletes database objects like tables, views, or indexes.

4. TRUNCATE : Removes all data from a table but retains the table structure for future use.
