Explain the use of the ORDER BY and WHERE clauses in SQL queries



order by : it is used in SQL queries to sort the rows in the result set based on one or more columns. 
           Sorting can be done in either ascending order (default) or descending order.

        
        ASC (Ascending Order): The default order if no sort direction is specified. 
                               Values are sorted from smallest to largest (e.g., A-Z, 0-9).
        
        DESC (Descending Order): Values are sorted from largest to smallest (e.g., Z-A, 9-0).


where : it is used in SQL queries to filter rows based on specific conditions. 
        Only rows that satisfy the condition(s) are included in the result set.
