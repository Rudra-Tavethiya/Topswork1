Explain how transactions are managed in SQL databases.



The SQL Transaction Process : 
            
            BEGIN TRANSACTION: Starts a transaction. 
                              
            COMMIT: Commits the transaction, saving all changes made. 
                              
            ROLLBACK: Rolls back the transaction, undoing all changes made since the BEGIN TRANSACTION 

            SAVEPOINT: Marks a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
