What are the implications of dropping a table from a database?



Permanent Deletion of Data : All data stored in the table is permanently deleted.
                             without backup we can not reuse the data.

Loss of Table Structure : The tableâ€™s columns, data types, constraints, etc. is completely removed from the database.
                          If we need the table for that we have to recreate the table
