What is the purpose of the COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands in SQL?



commit : it is used to save all changes made during the run the code in mysql
         once a COMMIT is used, the changes become visible to other users and cannot be undone.

rollback : it is used to undo all changes made during the run code if an error occurs 
           changes are reverted to the state before the transaction started.
