Explain the concept of SAVEPOINT in transaction management. How do ROLLBACK and COMMIT interact with savepoints? 




when we run the sql qury at that rime we have to add save point in the transaction by that we can redirect
at that point went we are call that point

we can redirect to perticuler savepoint by calling rollback command with that perticuler savepoint

by the COMMIT we can save the data permanantly in database 
we can not rollback at that point when we COMMIT the data
