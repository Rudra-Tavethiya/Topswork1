insert : insert command is used for add new row in the table.
        
        ex : we add row in student table. values are in according to student_id, name, mobile_no, DOB 

            syntex : insere into table_name values (value1, value2, value3, ...);

            code : insert into student values (1,"rudra",9316977670,"2004-09-12");

            syntex : update table_name set column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... where condition;

            code : update student set name="karan" where student_id=1;

delete : delete command is used to remove the record from table.
         we can use by where to specify which row to delete.

        ex : here we are delete the row from table where the student id = 1

            syntex : delete from table_name where condition;

            code : dleete from student where student_id=1;
