Explain the CREATE command and its syntax.



The CREATE command in SQL is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command used to create new database objects such as tables. 
It is one of the fundamental commands for defining the structure of a database.



Creating a Database : by that we can create the data base.
            
            Syntax : CREATE DATABASE database_name;

Creating a Table : by that we can create the table.

            syntex : CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name1 data_type constraint, 
                                              column_name2 data_type constraint, 
                                              ...);
