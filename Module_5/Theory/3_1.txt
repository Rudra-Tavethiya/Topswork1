What are constraints in SQL ? List and explain the different types of constraints


constraints : it is rules or restrictions applied to columns in a table to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and reliability.



PRIMARY KEY : Ensures that a column (or combination of columns) uniquely identifies each row in a table.
                    Uniqueness: No duplicate values are allowed.
                    Non-Null: Cannot contain NULL values.

FOREIGN KEY : Enforces a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key in another table.
                    Ensures referential integrity.
                    Prevents actions that would break the link between related tables.

UNIQUE : Ensures that all values in a column (or a group of columns) are distinct.
                    Allows one NULL value (depending on the database).
                    A table can have multiple unique constraints.

NOT NULL : Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.
                    Forces data entry into the column.

DEFAULT : Assigns a default value to a column when no value is specified during insertion.
                    Automatically inserts the specified default value.

CHECK : Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
                    Enforces custom rules on column values.
