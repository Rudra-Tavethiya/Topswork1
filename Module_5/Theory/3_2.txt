How do PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints differ ?



PRIMARY KEY : A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.
                    Combines uniqueness and non-nullability.
                    Cannot have duplicate or NULL values.

            The primary key in the parent table ensures each row is uniquely identifiable.

            ex : CREATE TABLE Employees (EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(50));



FOREIGN KEY : A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.
                    Ensures referential integrity by preventing actions (e.g., deletion of parent records) that break the link.
                    Can allow duplicate or NULL values in the child table.

            The foreign key in the child table references the primary key in the parent table to establish a relationship.
        
            ex : CREATE TABLE Orders (OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY, EmployeeID INT, FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID));
