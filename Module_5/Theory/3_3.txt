What is the role of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints ?



NOT NULL Constraint : Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.
                      Used to enforce mandatory data entry in a specific column.

                The column must always have a value.
                Prevents accidental omission of critical data during insertion or update operations.


UNIQUE Constraint : Ensures that all values in a column (or a combination of columns) are distinct.
                    Used to prevent duplicate entries in a specific column or set of columns.

                A column with a UNIQUE constraint can allow only one NULL value (depending on the database system).
                A table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints on different columns.
