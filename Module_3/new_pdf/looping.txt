Compare and contrast while loops, for loops, and do-while loops. 
Explain the scenarios in which each loop is most appropriate.

while loop : while loop is check the condition first, if the condition is false the loop is not run
    
    syntex : while(condition){
                code to excute
             }
    example : #include<stdio.h>
              int main(){
                int num=1;
                while(num<=5){
                    printf("%d  ",num);
                    i++;
                }
              }

for loop : in for loop the initialization is runs first then cheack the condition and if the condition
           is true then the code will be excute by the increment/decrement 

    syntex : for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
                code to be excute
             }

    example : #include<stdio.h>
              int main(){
                int i;
                for(i=1;i<=5;i++){
                    printf("%d  ",i);
                }
              }

do-while loop : this loop is excute the block of code first then after it check the condition,
                then if the condition is true the loop is repet that.

    syntex : do{
                code to be excute
             }
             while(condition)

    example : #include<stdio.h>
              int main(){
                int i=1;
                do{
                    printf("%d  ",i);
                    i++;
                }
                while(i<=5);
              }
