Explain the concept of structures in C.
Describe how to declare, initialize, an access structure members.

structure : this is a user-defined data type that allows grouping different types of 
            variables under a single name.

declare the structure : struct student{
                            int age;
                            char name[20];
                            float persentage;
                        }

initialize the structure : int main{
                               struct student s1;
                               s1.age=20;
                               s1.name=rudra;
                               s1.persentage=89.63; 
                           }

access strucure member : printf("%d",s1.age);
                         printf("%s",s1.name);
                         printf("%.2f",s1.persentage);
