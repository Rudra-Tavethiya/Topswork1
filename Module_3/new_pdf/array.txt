Explain the concept of arrays in C. Differentiate between one-dimensional and 
multi-dimensional arrays with examples.

array : array is the collection of elements whith same data type and strored in 
        continues memory location.

one-dimensional array : this is the collection of elements of same data type.
                        it is like a list or a row of same data type items.

        example : int arr[]={85,65,26,35,74,19,42,31,99,11};

multi-dimensional array : this is the array in array we can stored elements 
                          in rows and colums (matrix).
        
        example : int arr[3][3]={{1,2,3},
                                 {4,5,6},
                                 {7,8,9}};
