Explain what pointers are in C and how they are declared and initialized.
Why are pointers important in C?

pointers : pointers are variable that stored address in another variable.

declaration : to declared the pointer, apecify the datatype then start sign (*) the the name of variable.
           
        syntex : int *ptr;


initialization : to initialized the pointer we have to use sign (&) 

        syntex : ptr=&num;

importance of pointer : it is shows the memory address
                        it is used in data structure.
