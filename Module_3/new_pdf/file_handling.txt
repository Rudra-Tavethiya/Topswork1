File Handling in C
THEORY EXERCISE: Explain the importance of filehandling in C. Discuss how toper form file operations like opening, closing,
                 reading, and writing files.



importance of file handaling : it is allowing the storing the data in file permanently.
                               it is allowing the shareing the data between two program.
                               it is allowing the read and write data in other file from the program.

    opening files : we have to use fopen() function to open the file. 
                    
                    there are perticuer modes to read and write a file.
                        "r" = open for reading the file
                        "w" = open for writing the file
                        "w+" = open for read and write the file

        syntex :  file  *file_pointer  =  fopen("file name" , "mode");

    reading files : we have to use fscanf() function to read the data from file

    writing files : we have to use fprintf() function to read the data form file

    closeing the file : we have to use fclose() function to read the data from file
