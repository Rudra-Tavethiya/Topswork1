What are functions in C ? Explain function declaration, definition, and how to call a function.
Provide examples.

function : function is the block of code that perform specific task. and it is perform the task 
           when it is called.

function declaration : this is specifies the function's name,  peramiters. it tells the compailes
                       the function name.

function definition : this is the block of code that would be excute. 
                      this is the body of function.

calling a function : To run the program we need to call the function in main program.
                     by the write the name of function and peramiters we can excute the function

     example : #include<stdio.h>
               int area(int a){                                  //function declaration
                printf("\n area of the squre is : %d",a*a);      // function definition
               }
               int main(){
                   int a;
                   printf("\n enter length of squre : ");
                   scanf("%d",&a);
                   area(a);                                      //calling the function
               }
