What is a function in C++ ? Explain the concept of function declaration , definition , and calling.


function :  it is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. 
            Functions allow you to organize code into reusable pieces, making programs easier to read, maintain, and debug.

        Function Declaration (Prototype) :  Specifies the function's name, return type, and parameters.
                                            Tells the compiler what to expect, without providing the function body.

        Function Definition : Contains the actual implementation of the function.
                              Includes the function's body with the logic to perform the task.

        Function Call : Invokes the function to execute its code.
