What are conditional statements in C++ ? Explain the if-else and switch statements.


conditional statements : it allow you to make decisions based on conditions. 
                         These statements control the flow of execution by checking specific conditions and executing blocks of code


            if statements : if the condition is true then executing the block of code
                    syntex : if(condition){
                                block of code
                             }

            if-else statements : if ~ the condition is true then executing the block of code
                                 else ~ the condition is not true then executing the block of code
                    syntex : if(condition){
                                block of code
                             }
                             else{
                                block of code
                             }

            else if statements : if there are many condition then that time use else if statement
                    syntex : if(condition){
                                block of code
                             }
                             else if(condition){
                                block of code
                             }
                             else if(condition){
                                block of code
                             }
                             else{
                                block of code
                             }

            switch statement : Used for selecting one of many code blocks to execute.
                               The value of a variable/expression is compared against multiple case labels.
                    syntex : switch(choice){
                                case 1: block of code

                                case 2: block of code

                                case 3: block of code

                                default: block of code
                             }
