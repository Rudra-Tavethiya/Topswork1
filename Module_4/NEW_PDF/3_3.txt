How are break and continue statements used in loops ? Provide examples.

break statements : Used to immediately terminate the loop regardless of the loop's condition.
                    
            When the break statement is encountered, the control exits the loop, skipping any remaining iterations.

       ex : #include <iostream>
            using namespace std;

            int main() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    if (i == 5) {
                        break;  // Exit the loop when i equals 5
                    }
                    cout << i << " ";
                }
            }

        output : 0 1 2 3 4

        The loop terminates when i becomes 5 due to the break statement.



continue statements : Used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration.
           
            When the continue statement is encountered, the remaining statements in the loop body for the current iteration are skipped, 
            and the next iteration begins.

       ex : #include <iostream>
            using namespace std;

            int main() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    if (i == 5) {
                        continue;  // Skip the iteration when i equals 5
                    }
                    cout << i << " ";
                }
            }

        Output: 0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9

        When i equals 5, the continue statement skips the rest of the loop body, and the loop proceeds with the next iteration.
