Whatis inheritance in C++? Explain with an example.



inheritance : It allows one class (derived class) to inherit properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) from 
              another class (base class). This promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

        syntex : class BaseClass {
                    // Members of the base class
                 };
                 
                 class DerivedClass : access_specifier BaseClass {
                    // Additional members of the derived class
                 };

        types of inheritance : 

                Single Inheritance          : One derived class inherits from one base class.
                Multiple Inheritance        : A derived class inherits from multiple base classes.
                Multilevel Inheritance      : A derived class inherits from another derived class.
                Hierarchical Inheritance    : Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
                Hybrid Inheritance          : Combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance.
              

        ex of single inheritance : 
             #include <iostream>
             using namespace std;
             class Animal {
                public:
                void eat() {
                    cout << "This animal eats food." << endl;
                }
             };

             class Dog : public Animal {
                public:
                void bark() {
                    cout << "The dog barks." << endl;
                }
             };

             int main() {
                Dog myDog;
            
                myDog.eat();
                myDog.bark();
             }
