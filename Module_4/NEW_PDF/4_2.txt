What is the scope of variables in C++ ? Differentiate between local and global scope


scope of a variable : it refers to the part of the program where the variable is accessible.
                      It determines the visibility and lifetime of a variable.


Aspect	            |   Local Scope	                                          |   Global Scope
--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------
Declaration	        |   Inside a function or block.	                          |   Outside of all functions or blocks.
Accessibility	    |   Limited to the function/block.	                      |   Accessible from anywhere in the program.
Lifetime	        |   Exists only during the function/block execution.      |   Exists throughout the program execution.
Memory	            |   Allocated in the stack (temporary).	                  |   Allocated in the global memory segment.
Default Value	    |   Uninitialized by default.	                          |   Initialized to 0 or equivalent default.
Risk of Conflict	|   No conflicts outside its block.	                      |   Can lead to naming conflicts or overwriting.
