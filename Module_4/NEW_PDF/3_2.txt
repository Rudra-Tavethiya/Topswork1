What is the difference between for, while, and do-while loops in C++ ?


for loop : Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
            The initialization step runs once at the start of the loop.
            The condition is checked before each iteration.
            The increment/decrement step executes after each iteration.

    syntex : for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                    // Body of the loop
             }

wile-loop : Used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop should run based on a condition.
            The condition is evaluated before each iteration.
            If the condition is false initially, the loop will not run.

    syntex : while (condition) {
                // Body of the loop
             }

do-while loop : Similar to while loop, but ensures the loop body is executed at least once.
            The loop body executes first, then the condition is checked.
            If the condition is true, the loop repeats.

    syntex : do {
                // Body of the loop
             } 
             while (condition);
