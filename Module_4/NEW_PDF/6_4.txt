What is encapsulation in C++? How is it achieved in classes?



Encapsulation : it is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 

                It is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on 
                the data into a single unit, typically a class. 

                Encapsulation ensures that the internal details of a class are hidden from the outside world, providing 
                a way to restrict direct access to some components and allowing controlled access through specific methods.


        How Encapsulation is Achieved in C++

            Classes: To group data members and member functions.
            Access Specifiers:
                private: Members are accessible only within the class.
                protected: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
                public: Members are accessible from outside the class
