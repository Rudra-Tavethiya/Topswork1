What are function prototypes in C++ ? Why are they used ?



function prototype : it is a declaration of a function that specifies its name, return type, and parameters (if any),
                     but does not include the function body. 
                     It tells the compiler what the function looks like before its actual definition or usage.

            declaration of function : by that the compailer is allows to use the function in program.

            return type : The compiler checks the function calls against the prototype to ensure the number and types of arguments are passed.
