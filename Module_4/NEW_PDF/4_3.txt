Explain recursion in C++ with an example.


Recursion : it is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.
            In C++, recursion is implemented by defining a function that calls itself with modified parameters and includes 
            a base condition to terminate the recursion


        ex : Factorial Calculation 
             code : #include <iostream>
                    using namespace std;
                    int main() {
                        int number;
                        cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
                        cin >> number;

                        if (number < 0) {
                            cout << "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers." << endl;
                        } 
                        else {
                            if (n == 0) {
                                return 1;
                            } 
                            else {
                                return n * factorial(n - 1);
                            }
                        }
                    }
