What are classes and objects in C++ ? Provide an example.


class : it is a blueprint for creating objects. 
        It defines the data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that operate on the data. 
        The class does not occupy memory until objects are created from it.

            syntex : class ClassName {
                        public:
                            // Access specifier
                            // Data members (attributes)
                            // Member functions (methods)
                     };

object : it is an instance of a class. 
         It is a tangible entity that has state (defined by data members) and behavior (defined by member functions). 
         Each object has its own copy of the classâ€™s data members.

            syntex : if the class name is "car"

                     car c1;                    // c1 is object
                     c1.brand = "toyota";       // Access data member
                     car1.model = "Corolla";    // Access data member
                     car1.year = 2020;          // Access data member
                     
                     c1.displayDetails();       // Call member function
